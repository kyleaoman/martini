Global profile mode
===================

Sometimes all you want is a spatially-integrated spectrum of a source. The :class:`~martini.martini.GlobalProfile` class offers a simplified setup of MARTINI 

Assumptions and limitations
---------------------------

In order to offer a simpler and faster way to produce a spectrum, the :class:`~martini.martini.GlobalProfile` class makes some assumptions:

 - No spatial aperture is assumed. Every particle in the source contributes to the spectrum (unless it falls outside of the spectral bandwidth).
 - The positions of particles are still used to calculate the line-of-sight vector and the velocity along this direction.

There is therefore no need or way to specify a beam or SPH kernel as with the main :class:`~martini.martini.Martini` class. It is also not possible to use MARTINI's noise modules with this class. If these restrictions are found to be too limiting, the best course of action is to produce a spatially-resolved mock observation and derive the spectrum from those data as would be done with "real" observations. For example, if the spectrum within a spatial mask defined by a signal-to-noise or other cut is desired, or if spatially-dependent effects like primary beam attenuation are relevant, then the :class:`~martini.martini.GlobalProfile` class should not be used. The :class:`~martini.martini.GlobalProfile` class is mainly intended to efficiently provide a "quick look" at the spectrum, or a reference "ideal" spectrum.

Usage
-----

The :doc:`source </sources/index>` and :doc:`spectral model </spectral_models/index>` modules should be set up as for a full MARTINI mock observation. The :doc:`beam </beams/index>`, :doc:`noise </noise/index>` and :doc:`sph_kernel </sph_kernels/index>` modules are not relevant. The :doc:`datacube </datacube/index>` module is not used, but a subset of its configuration options are instead given directly to the :class:`~martini.martini.GlobalProfile`. Schematically, an example initialisation looks like:

.. code-block:: python

    from martini import GlobalProfile
    from martini.sources import SPHSource
    from martini.spectral_models import GaussianSpectrum
		
    source = SPHSource(...)
    spectral_model = GaussianSpectrum(...)

    gp = GlobalProfile(
        source=source,
	spectral_model=spectral_model,
	n_channels=64,
	channel_width=10 * U.km * U.s**-1,
	velocity_centre=source.vsys,
	channels="velocity",
    )

The arguments to the other modules are omitted here (replaced with ``...``), check the documentation pages of each module for details. Here the spectrum will be centred on the source systemic velocity, but an explicit frequency or Doppler velocity value could be given instead. The ``channels`` argument determines whether the resulting spectrum will have channel edges in velocity or frequency units. The units (frequency or velocity) of the ``channel_width`` and ``velocity_centre``, and whether ``channels`` is set to ``"frequency"`` or ``"velocity"``, can be mixed in any combination.

Inserting the source
--------------------

The spectrum can be accessed through the ``spectrum`` attribute:

.. code-block:: python

    gp.spectrum

If it has not yet been calculated, it will be calculated when accessed. The calculation can be explicitly forced with:

.. code-block:: python

    gp.insert_source_in_spectrum()

but this is not usually necessary. In addition to the spectrum itself, the centres and edges of the channels are available as:

.. code-block:: python

    gp.channel_mids
    gp.channel_edges

respectively. These arrays will have dimensions of frequency or velocity depending on the ``channels`` argument passed to :class:`~martini.martini.GlobalProfile` on initialization.

Parallelization
+++++++++++++++

The core loop in the source insertion function is a loop over pixels. Since parallelization is implemented for this loop, and for a :class:`~martini.martini.GlobalProfile` there is a single pixel, parallelization is not available in this mode.

Quick plot of the spectrum
--------------------------

As a convenience, a function is provided to make a quick plot showing the spectrum. Whether the systemic velocity of the source (as reported by ``source.vsys``) is shown by a vertical dotted line is controlled by the ``show_vsys`` argument.

.. code-block:: python

    from martini import demo_source, GlobalProfile
    from martini.spectral_models import GaussianSpectrum

    source = demo_source(N=20000)  # create a simple disc with 20000 particles
    gp = GlobalProfile(
        source=source,
	spectral_model=GaussianSpectrum(sigma=7 * U.km * U.s**-1),
	n_channels=128,
	channel_width=2.5 * U.km * U.s**-1,
	velocity_centre=source.vsys,
	channels="velocity",
    )
    gp.plot_spectrum(
        show_vsys=True,
    )

The resulting figure is returned by the function, or can be directly saved to file with the ``save`` argument (e.g. ``save="myplot.png"`` or ``save="myplot.pdf"``). This example looks like:

.. image:: spectrum1.png
    :width: 350
    :alt: Example spectrum of a simple rotating disc source.
